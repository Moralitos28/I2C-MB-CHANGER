# I2C-MB-CHANGER
This tutorial is just for change the I2C IDENTIFICATION HEX in  a Modern Robotix Color Sensor; I tested it in a 45-2018 ( https://www.modernroboticsinc.com/color-sensor ) using just a simple arduino instead of expensive original reprogramer module. We use two of them at the same time and they work well in a MyRio. But in the concept it will work well in all platforms!

!!!! USE THE AUTO-PROGRAM NAMED ..BY_CONSOLE ! IT IS EASIER OR V.2 TO CHANGE MANUALY!
